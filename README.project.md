What is the goal(s) of the project? What is this project trying to do? A newcomer has to understand what you wrote here. Be concise. 

## Current status:
What is the current status. What is achieved? what is not still working. 
try to keep it to 3-4 sentences. A newcomer has to understand what you wrote here.

## Roles: 
Who is involved in this project ?
- **main driver**: Who is doing the bulk of the analysis work. Writing code, processing data?
- **support work**: Who is helping out with ideas, pre-made scripts, know-how or small custom analysis?
- **supervision**: Who is doing the project management and has the birds-eye view

## Presentations & reports: 
google drive or dropbox-alike link or multiple links or locations of presentations on our servers.
Each list item starts with document type, then continues with short explanation and a link/location. 
- **presentation:** initial results and QC for raw data. [ link: location or link ] 
- **presentation:** Intermediate results, clustering for samples, initial regression models for x,y,z  [ link: location or link ] 
- **presentation:** Presentation that has the story flow and figures of the paper  [ link: location or link ] 
- **report:** report on clustering results   [ link: location or link ] 


## Experiments & failed ideas: 
link to presentation or document where you collect the failed ideas and experiments.
Failed ideas are avenues/paths you stopped pursuing because it didnâ€™t work. 
There is usually a figure or a table showing that the idea is failed. 
Paste that figure/table to the document (google doc or slides). 
This is very important to keep track number of failed ideas/ experiments, this is somewhat of a KPI. 
Example and template for experiments -> https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1scBtJbgTb26KBKKlosXOl0elbiw3J9fgLIBXuNzPswQ/edit?usp=sharing
You can use the template or make sure you have a concise document that has an easy to understand structure to document your experiments. 


## Draft paper: 
googledocs link to draft paper. Provide a link or write: no link yet. if there is no link

## Prerequisite reading:  
which previously published papers are relevant for this project? ** Do not list more than 5**.
- This paper deals with x,y,z. We have a similar approach here. [ link: location or link ] 
- This paper deals with x cells. We also work on x cells for this project. [ link: location or link ] 


## Prerequisite skills:
What a newcomer needs to know to replicate what you have done and improve it? 
Does s/he need to know R, python, snakeMake, any particular packages?
